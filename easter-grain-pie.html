    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat berries</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package mixed candied fruit</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 pastries for 9-inch lattice-top pies</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium low heat; pour in wheat and boil for 40 minutes. As wheat is cooking, beat eggs in a large bowl while gradually adding 1 cup sugar to eggs. Mix in ricotta, candied fruit, orange zest, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer while gradually adding in 1 cup sugar. Mix in ricotta, candied fruit, orange zest, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>When wheat is ready, drain in a colander and rinse with warm water. Place 3/4 cup of cooked wheat in a small bowl; stir in butter and salt until butter is melted, then stir wheat mixture into ricotta mixture along with remaining cooked wheat berries.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line two 9-inch pie pans with pastry. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2-inch wide strips for tops of pies. Spoon 1/2 of the filling into each pan; cover with pastry strips to form a lattice pattern. Crimp edges.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle each pie with 1 tablespoon sugar and allow to cool at room temperature. Chill overnight before serving.</li>
   </ol>
